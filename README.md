# Quick CSS
### The CSS framework for those who want to write less
Quick CSS is a framework which lets you style your website without writing any CSS. All you have to do, is write in the class name and you are done.
## Installation
Copy and paste this into your `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Hot-Tutorials/Quick-CSS@master/Quick%20CSS/quick.css">
```
Or you can import it using CSS by doing:
```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Hot-Tutorials/Quick-CSS@master/Quick%20CSS/quick.css");
```

## Using Quick CSS
If you want to use Quick CSS, there is no need to credit it. This was meant for personal use but I wanted to allow the public to use it. Its free, no credit required. You can copy snippets of code from it as long as you don't completely copy it and rename the whole thing.
